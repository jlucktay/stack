# `stack`

A support tool for use with Terraform stacks.

It currently has the following functions:

- queueing builds
- cancelling builds
- creating issues

All of these functions are executed contextually against a specific stack.

For further implementation, [this package](https://github.com/google/go-github) looks very useful.
